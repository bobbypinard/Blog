# Podcasts For the Budding Cyber Security Enthusiast

---

I have been listening to podcasts for years now. Podcasts are great because they're usually longer form shows that can be packed full of information. The Linux Action Show was my first foray into the medium. Since then I have used podcasts for keeping up with news, learning new technologies, and entertainment. Here are my favorite podcasts about tech.




### Daily Security news briefings

<u>SANS ISC Stormcast</u>: Despite the logo looking like it was made by a 12 year old in MS Paint, the SANS ISC Stormcast is a great little 5-10 minute news briefing every morning by the SANS institute’s research director Dr. Johannes Ullrich. He really knows how to give the important technical details and none of the filler.

<u>The Cyber Wire</u>: The Cyber Wire is a more in depth briefing on the day’s happenings. There's also a technical segment with an expert at the end. Lately Juniper Networks has sponsored them to do "Resaerch Saturdays" which is a deep dive conversation with researchers and analysts on what vulnerabilities are plaguing the cyberspace.




### Long Form Security Podcasts

<u>Beers With Talos</u>: Five Talos security researchers and managers host this podcast which discusses the fortnight’s happenings. They also occasionally have different guests from cyber security to talk about their research or events coming up. This is a pretty jokey podcast and you get to know the personalities of Talos.

<u>Paul’s Security Weekly</u>: Paul's Security Weekly is the functional dysfunctional family of security podcasts. It has several international hosts from pentesting, government, corporate and small business security all drinking and making sly jabs at each other while making the best three hour security podcast there is. They usually have multiple guests do deep dives on security topics. It’s good if you want to get an idea of how multiple different departments approach security.

<u>Down The Security Rabbithole</u>: Down The Security Rabbithole gives the oh so important perspective of how security affects business. They bring guests on to talk about how different vulnerabilities affect business and how to bridge the gap between the technical security side and the corporate suits.

<u>Tech Snap</u>: Tech Snap is more of a Sys/Network Admin centric podcast, but they also do technical deep dives into security news. Because this podcast is done by two tech enthusiasts, they often geek out about new hardware of software which is always fun to do.




### Security History

<u>Malicious Life</u>: Malicious Life is a great storytelling podcast with high production value. It is also done by an Israeli, so you get more of an international perspective rather than the many US centric podcasts I feature here. I highly recommend their multi episode coverage on Stuxnet.

![Darknet Diaries](assets/DD.webp)
<u>Darknet Diaries</u>: Jack Rhysider does an amazing job at telling these stories. He usually brings the main person in the story to the podcast to actually give insider detail. I recommend listening to the Black Duck Eggs episode ASAP.




### FOSS Centric

<u>Bad Voltage</u>: Much like how Paul's Security Weekly is the functional dysfunctional family of security podcasts, it's pretty safe to say that Bad Voltage is the functional dysfunctional family of open source podcasts. Heated debate and sly jabs are commonplace in Bad Voltage, but they always provide their listeners with a fun podcast that is also informative on the fortnight's tech news.

<u>Choose Linux</u>: Choose Linux is in a bit of a transitional period right now. It was following Forbes write Jason Evangelho's switch to Linux and the joys of discovering Linux, but because of things in Jason's life, he is no longer cohosting the podcast. Now it seems like Joe Ressington will be talking to different people who are new to Linux and find out what they are liking about it and what possible struggles they're having.

![Linux Unplugged](assets/LUP.webp)
<u>Linux Unplugged</u>: Being originally a companion show to the now defunct Linux Action Show, Linux Unplugged is a show where anyone can join the voice chat room to express their views on the topics discussed. That being said, Chris and Wes do moderate the discussion so that it doesn't get out of hand. It was made to have the feel of a Linux User Group of the 90s and it does an amazing job at that.

![User Error](assets/UE.webp)
<u>User Error</u>: User Error started as a show that was a place for the Jupiter Broadcasting hosts to talk about random tech things that interested them, but is now more of another tech show like the old Tech Talk Today they used to release. This is a good podcast if you want to know the Jupiter Broadcasting hosts on a more personal level and what piques their interests.




### Software Development

![Coder Radio](assets/CR.webp)
<u>Coder Radio</u>: Mike and Wes have a lively conversation every week about what they've been doinng in software development and what's been happening in the industry. You get a good perspective of the startup and remote work culture because of Mike's company The Mad Botter. Lately they have been doing a by-weekly code challenge where each person picks up a new language and tries to learn it in two weeks and reports back.

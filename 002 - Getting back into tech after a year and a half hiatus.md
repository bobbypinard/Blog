At the rate that tech evolves, getting back into the industry after a year and a half is certainly a daunting task, but when you've had the last year and a half that I've had, it seems like the only way to keep some sense of sanity.

## My past experience
My first real tech job was developing the front end for a security camera system with a small company here in Houston. I got that job because some of my friends and I had gone to the University of Houston Clear Lake's robotics competition and won first place. After that job, I moved into an IT technician role at a small mom 'n pop IT shop in the suburbs. This was a great experience for me because it showed me what I didn't want to do for the rest of my life. I also got good experience in diagnosing PC problems, networking and PHP development. I then moved on to a remote front end position at a dev shop. The job was pretty amazing because I got to work for someone I've looked up to as a sort of celebrity in the software development world. That job was a lot of fun because I got to work with the bleeding edge of JavaScript and web technologies at the time.

On New Years day of 2018 I got a call I was dreading for a few weeks. We had lost the contract I was working on. That had given my world quite a big shake up seeing that the night before, I made plans for the following year. After getting laid off I focused on growing my GitHub profile by getting better with my VueJS development and I started learning ReactJS. I applied to many companies around the Houston area, but didn't get any hits on my applications. Since then I have worked in a grocery store as an online shopping fulfiller for 5 months and now have been working in the oil fields for over a year.

## What I've been doing now
I saw that the main thing I was lacking was credentials. I have experience in IT and software development, but not many credentials. To fix this, as I said, I've grown my GitHub now with Vue, React and Angular. I have gone back to school to get my degree in Cyber Security. I have also attained a CompTIA A+, Network+ and am currently pursuing a Cisco CCNA.

While the industry moves at break neck speed, I also subscribe to multiple different channels of information on it to keep ahead of the curve. As I wrote in an earlier [blog](https://medium.com/@bobby.pinard_63669/podcasts-for-the-budding-cyber-security-enthusiast-e2af68d40b66) I listen to multiple podcasts on software development, open source and cyber security. In addition to that I also watch many tech YouTubers like Linus Tech Tips, JayzTwoCents and Hak5. One thing that I recently found that has been very inspiring is a new podcast called [Getting Into Infosec](https://gettingintoinfosec.simplecast.fm/). In this podcast, host Ayman Elsawah talks to people who have recently gotten into Infosec. They talk about education, previous jobs, advice for future infosec professionals and any other topics that might come up. I highly recommend a listen for anyone trying to break into the industry.

## Moving forward
If I was to give one piece of advice to anyone trying to get into tech after being absent for awhile, I would say to keep up with trends and perservere. I understand that at times it can feel like you're fighting a losing battle by learning about new security vulnerabilities and new technologies being released, but not being able to use it in the corporate environment, but what's great about tech is that you can test out stuff in a VM. You can learn all there is on a certain topic because there's a million people writing about it and making videos on YouTube. There's always a way to get more information on a topic and test out your skills. Keep learning, and you'll be alright.

I am still currently looking for a position in system administration or development, but I have high hopes! I'll keep y'all posted.
